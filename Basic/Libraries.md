Principais bibliotecas: 

- #include<stdio.h>: It is used to perform input and output operations using functions scanf() and printf().

- #include<stdlib.h>: Stdlib.h is a header file of the standard general purpose library of the C programming language. It has functions involving memory allocation (malloc, calloc), process control, conversions (atoi, atol), pseudo-random sequence generation (rand, random) and others.

- #include<iostream>: It is used as a stream of Input and Output using cin and cout.

- #include<string.h>: It is used to perform various functionalities related to string manipulation like strlen(), strcmp(), strcpy(), size(), etc.

- #include<math.h>: It is used to perform mathematical operations like sqrt(), log2(), pow(), etc.

- #include<iomanip.h>: It is used to access set() and setprecision() function to limit the decimal places in variables.

- #include<signal.h>: It is used to perform signal handling functions like signal() and raise().

- #include<stdarg.h>:It is used to perform standard argument functions like va_start() and va_arg(). It is also used to indicate start of the variable-length argument list and to fetch the arguments from the variable-length argument list in the program respectively.

- #include<errno.h>: It is used to perform error handling operations like errno(), strerror(), perror(), etc.

- #include<fstream.h>: It is used to control the data to read from a file as an input and data to write into the file as an output.

- #include<time.h>: It is used to perform functions related to date() and time() like setdate() and getdate(). It is also used to modify the system date and get the CPU time respectively.

- #include<float.h>: It contains a set of various platform-dependent constants related to floating point values. These constants are proposed by ANSI C. They allow making programs more portable. Some examples of constants included in this header file are- e(exponent), b(base/radix), etc.

- #include<limits.h>: It determines various properties of the various variable types. The macros defined in this header, limits the values of various variable types like char, int, and long. These limits specify that a variable cannot store any value beyond these limits, for example an unsigned character can store up to a maximum value of 255.

- #include<assert.h>: It contains information for adding diagnostics that aid program debugging.

- #include<ctype.h>: It contains function prototypes for functions that test characters for certain properties , and also function prototypes for functions that can be used to convert uppercase letters to lowercase letters and vice versa.

- #include<locale.h>: It contains function prototypes and other information that enables a program to be modified for the current locale on which itâ€™s running. It enables the computer system to handle different conventions for expressing data such as times, dates or large numbers throughout the world.

- #include<setjmp.h>: It contains function prototypes for functions that allow bypassing of the usual function call and return sequence.
- #include<stddef.h>: It contains common type definitions used by C for performing calculations.

Non-Standard Header File And its Uses:

- #include<bits/stdc++.h>: It contains all standard library of the header files mentioned above. So if you include it in your code, then you need not have to include any other standard header files. But as it is a non-standard header file of GNU C++ library, so, if you try to compile your code with some compiler other than GCC it might fail; e.g. MSVC do not have this header.
