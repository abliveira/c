What If I Don’t Want to Dynamically Allocate Memory?

There are some reading this that have their spidey sense tingling when they see the word calloc in ringbuffer_create.

In many embedded systems, dynamic memory allocation is strongly discouraged or outright forbidden. Even if it’s not forbidden, it’s often a good idea to eliminate dynamic memory if static memory suffices.

In the example, we could statically allocate an array of some maximum number of ringbuffers, and give the user a uint32_t handle, which is an index into the array.

The example code would look slightly different:

Notice that it’s still possible to run out of instances, which is similar to a dynamic memory allocation failure. The benefit of static memory is that problems like fragmentation are avoided. Ultimately, the system designer still needs to think about how to handle failed instance creation.

One downside to this approach is that it can be wasteful of memory. If you create an array that is capable of holding 100 instances, and you only ever create one instance, then you’ve wasted the memory of 99 instances. Furthermore, for a specific instance, if the user only needs a capacity of 25, then the other 75 slots are completely unused.

Some might balk at the performance of the linear scan in ringbuffer_create. In practice, I’ve found it’s rarely a concern, especially if you have a small number of instances (ten or less), or if you rarely call *_create (e.g. only once at system startup).

The linear scan could become a concern if you create and destroy instances many times (e.g. inside of a loop), or if you have a large number of instances, in which case you probably don’t want to pay the O(n) price each time. For those cases, a linked list of available instances is a good approach.

My personal approach - dynamic memory is okay if it’s only allocated at system startup, and not during normal operation. The implementation is much simpler using dynamic memory.
